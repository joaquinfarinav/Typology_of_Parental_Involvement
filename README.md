This study investigates whether a typology of parental involvement in their children's education exists in Chile and whether these types of parental involvement are associated with different student outcomes. Using latent class analysis on a dataset of nearly 240,000 parents of 8th-grade students in Chile, this study identifies five distinct classes of parents based on their response patterns in parental expectations, proactive support, rule setting at home, and monitoring. The study finds that the classes vary significantly in their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Additionally, there are significant differences in student outcomes, such as GPA, attendance, and grade retention, across the different classes of parental involvement. The study contributes to the literature on parental involvement by providing insights into the different forms of parental involvement that exist in a developing country context.
